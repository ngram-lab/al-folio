BTO this works for me

1. `python compile_yaml.py`   <- needed for new grid layout
2. `bundle exec jekyll serve`

maybe also other jekyll commands?

I used homebrew ruby on mac (`brew install ruby`) which it in a dir off path so for me it was
`/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby/bin/bundle`, `/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby/bin/ruby` etc.
