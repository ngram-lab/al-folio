<li>CICS offers <a href="https://www.cics.umass.edu/degrees">several undergraduate programs</a>, including Computer Science and Informatics, which are great to study NLP.
The CS major includes an NLP subplan/track [TODO updated link?].
</li>
<li>Linguistics, in collaboration with CICS, offers a degree in Computational Linguistics, which allows for a greater emphasis on NLP related linguistics coursework. The normal Linguistics major may be appropriate as well.</li>
