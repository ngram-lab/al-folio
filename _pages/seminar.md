Read the following research paper before class, and bring a printout or electronic copy. Formulate at least two questions and be prepared to discuss in class: (1) a clarification question, about something you'd like to understand better about the paper; and (2) a question or comment about something you found interesting, would like to know more about, or an idea for future work.

### Course description

This 1-credit discussion course meets Wednesdays, 11:30am-12:45pm, room CS 142 during the semester.
Instructor: [Brendan O'Connor](http://brenocon.com) (<a href="mailto:brenocon@cs.umass.edu ">email</a>)

For spring 2025, the NLP seminar will focus on reading and discussing the research papers of the NLP research visitors.  Visitor talks will often not be at the class discussion time, but enrolled students will be required to attend or do make-up activities.  When the schedule allows, our goal is to read papers before the researcher's visit, and be prepared to engage with questions and discussion.

Each week's session will focus on one or a few papers, such as the work authored by an upcoming visitor.  All participants will choose and read one or more papers for each week's session, and write reactions, comments, and bring questions to class.  Activities may include leading discussions and short presentations.

Depending on the schedule, the later part of the semester may feature talks and discussions of other NLP research topics.

{% comment %}
*Course catalog description:* Weekly seminar requiring students to read an NLP paper and discuss and review it from a variety of perspectives. Some weeks will feature invited speakers instead of paper reviews.  1 credit.
{% endcomment %}

The course is recommended for graduate students with experience in NLP, such as one from the [UMass NLP courses page](/courses/).  COMPSCI 485 and 685 may be the most relevant.
