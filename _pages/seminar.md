<h2>UMass NLP Seminar: Spring 2025</h2>

Time/location TBD

This semester, the NLP seminar will focus on reading and discussing the research papers of upcoming NLP visitors.  Attendance for their talks will be part of the seminar (though scheduled at different times).  Depending on the schedule, the later part of the semester may feature talks and discussions of other NLP research topics.
