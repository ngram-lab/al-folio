<h2>UMass NLP Seminar: Spring 2025</h2>

Time/location TBD

Course number: COMPSCI 692L

Weekly seminar requiring students to read an NLP paper and discuss and review it from a variety of perspectives. Some weeks will feature invited speakers instead of paper reviews.  1 credit.

For spring 2025, the NLP seminar will focus on reading and discussing the research papers of upcoming NLP visitors.  Attendance for their talks will be part of the seminar (though scheduled at different times).  Depending on the schedule, the later part of the semester may feature talks and discussions of other NLP research topics.
