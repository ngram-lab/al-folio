### Course description

This 1-credit discussion course meets Wednesdays, 11:30am-12:45pm, room CS 142 during the semester.
Instructor: [Brendan O'Connor](http://brenocon.com) (<a href="mailto:brenocon@cs.umass.edu ">email</a>)

For spring 2025, the NLP seminar will focus on reading and discussing the research papers of the NLP research visitors.  Visitor talks will often not be at the class discussion time, but enrolled students will be required to attend or do make-up activities.  When the schedule allows, our goal is to read papers before the researcher's visit, and be prepared to engage with questions and discussion.

Each week's session will focus on one or a few papers, such as the work authored by an upcoming visitor.  All participants will choose and read one or more papers for each week's session, and write reactions, comments, and bring questions to class.  Activities will primarily include participating in discussions.

Note the course schedule is front loaded for early in the semester.  Due to the required attendance (or equivlant makeup) at research talks on other days, we will end earlier in the semester.  The number of class sessions is chosen so that the total number of (class sessions + non-class talks) = the normal number of class sessions in a standard weekly 1-credit course.

Depending on the schedule, the later part of the semester may feature talks and discussions of other NLP research topics.

*Course catalog description:* Weekly seminar requiring students to read an NLP paper and discuss and review it from a variety of perspectives. Some weeks will feature invited speakers instead of paper reviews.  1 credit.

The course is recommended for graduate students with experience in NLP, such as one from the [UMass NLP courses page](/courses/).  COMPSCI 485 and 685 may be the most relevant.

### Course requirements

This course is structured about NLP research seminar visitors.  For each visitor, students are required to read a paper, and go to the talk.

For each researcher, you'll submit two reviews:
1. Paper review: Read in detail a research paper, and submit a summary and comments on [this Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScJM7rbg285ppEmRKfcma88CtNAysiHxh9Koz-om_t1mDUnVw/viewform?usp=dialog).  This is due either before the talk, or before the class session associated with that talk, whichever is earlier; see the schedule.  (No paper review is due for Spangher 2/5 since it's the first class session.)
2. Talk review: Take some notes during the talk. Afterward, write and submit comments on [this Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSddDVv77O1eN4Clh2iqKpCpqQ0Xg5QRr6tAYHlEbk51LC3k6w/viewform?usp=dialog).  This is due the day after the talk (but it might be easiest to submit it the same day, while it's still fresh).

Comments should be written in your own words.

Attendance is required at class sessions and talks, except for conflicting classes (for the talks), or for extenuating circumstances (in general).  Allowable extenuating circumstances are those according to official University policy, including personal, health, religious observances, official University travel, etc.  To make up a missed class session or talk, read an additional paper and submit a review through the form, and clearly mark what it's a makeup for.

### Other course details

If you'd like to participate but cannot sign up in SPIRE, please submit your information on [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf5Uo4iMSvNoTGbrPyTmrYNdB6hjhvZfMotpVOzaQPaR8rm1Q/viewform?usp=dialog).

We'll do communication through a Slack group.
