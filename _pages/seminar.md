# UMass NLP Seminar

This webpage will contain information on the Fall 2025 NLP seminar.
See further below for information about the seminar as a course.

## Schedule: Fall 2025

The NLP seminar takes place Wednesdays, 12:30pm - 1:45pm, in room LGRC A104 and on Zoom.

- Sept. 10: organizational meeting
- Sept. 17: [Katrin Erk](https://www.katrinerk.com/), UMass CICS and Linguistics, "Analyzing word token embeddings to assess meaning in context."
  - *Abstract:* Word token embeddings constitute a condensed record of utterances of many speakers. This makes them interesting as data for lexical semantics, for questions like: Can word embeddings tell us about the structure of polysemous words, and which properties distinguish different usage groups? Do word embeddings encode meaning distinctions that differ from dictionary senses, and if so, is this data or noise? Can word embeddings help us assess the subtle meaning changes that  constructions impose on their components? And, importantly: How can we test the performance of methods for analyzing word token embeddings, and under what circumstances can we rely on them? In this talk I discuss methods that we have been developing for studying lexical semantics through embeddings, and analyses we've done so far. 
  - *Bio:* Katrin Erk is a professor in the CS and Linguistics department at UMass Amherst. Her research expertise is in the area of computational linguistics, especially semantics. Katrin Erk completed her dissertation on tree description languages and ellipsis in the CS department at Saarland University in 2002. She did a postdoc in the computational linguistics department at Saarland University from 2002 to 2006. In 2006, she joined the Linguistics Department at the University of Texas at Austin, and starting in 2023 she had a joint appointment between the Linguistics and CS departments. She joined UMass Amherst in 2025.
